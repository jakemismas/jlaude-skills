# Install Framework

Install the Salesforce Claude Code Framework into a project directory.

## Usage

This command can be run from anywhere. It will install the framework to a target directory.

## Process

### Step 1: Determine Target Directory

Ask the user:
```
Where would you like to install the framework?

1. Current directory (.)
2. Specify a path
3. Install globally (~/.claude/)
```

If option 2, ask: "Enter the target directory path:"

### Step 2: Check for Existing Installation

Check if the target directory already has `.claude/hooks/skill-rules.json`.

**If exists**, ask:
```
Framework already installed in this directory.

Would you like to:
1. Update/overwrite with latest version
2. Cancel
```

### Step 3: Clone or Copy Framework

**Option A: If running from the framework repo directory:**
Copy these to target:
- `.claude/` directory (agents, commands, hooks)
- `dev/` directory (templates, active placeholder)
- `CLAUDE.md`

**Option B: If running from elsewhere:**
Clone from https://github.com/ehebert7/salesforce-claude-framework and copy files to target.

### Step 4: Preserve User Customizations

When updating an existing installation:
- **Preserve** `.claude/hooks/skill-rules.json` (user's skill config)
- **Preserve** `CLAUDE.md` if it has been customized
- **Update** agents, commands, and hook scripts

### Step 5: Confirmation

Display:
```

- dev/templates/       (3 templates)

NEXT STEPS:

2. Run /setup to configure skills and customize CLAUDE.md
